# Building RandBox from Scratch (4/5): Testing System and Quality Assurance

![randbox-home](/img/randbox-home.png)

## Test Philosophy

- Start specific, then go broader.
- Validate ranges, formats, and locale constraints.
- Use deterministic seeds for reproducibility.

## Coverage

- Basics: numeric ranges, string charsets, template placeholders
- Person: name locales, gender matching, birthday ranges
- Location: coordinate precision, phone formats, postal/zip
- Finance: Luhn validation, expiry bounds, currency codes
- Text: lengths and composition, emoji sets
- Time: bounds and rollovers, timezone correctness
- Web: protocol/domain/email rules, IP formats

## CI and Tooling

- Integrate tests into CI pipelines with reporting.
- Use lightweight fixtures and snapshot tests where helpful.

## Outcome

Confidence in correctness and stability lets RandBox be used for serious prototyping and testing workflows.
