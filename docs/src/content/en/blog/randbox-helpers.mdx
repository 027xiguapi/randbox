# RandBox Module Tour (3/12): helpers – Utility Toolkit

The helpers module adds selection, shuffling, formatting, and extensibility utilities.

**Overview**
- Collections: `pickone/pickset/shuffle`
- Text: `capitalize/pad`
- Extend: `set/mixin`

**Examples**
```ts
import RandBox from 'randbox'
const rb = new RandBox()
const tag = rb.pickone?.(['A','B','C'])
const many = rb.pickset?.(['x','y','z'], 2)
const mixed = rb.shuffle?.([1,2,3,4])
```

## FAQ

- Does `pickset` allow duplicates?
  - Typically returns unique items unless configured otherwise.
- Which shuffle algorithm?
  - Fisher–Yates for uniform distribution.
- Can `mixin` overwrite existing methods?
  - Possible; use cautiously and see docs for patterns.
