# RandBox Module Tour (5/12): miscellaneous – Probability and IDs

**Overview**
- Probability & weights: `coin/weighted/radio`
- Distributions & rules: `normal`, `dice/rpg/tv`
- IDs & uniqueness: `guid/hash/unique`, `fileWithContent`

**Examples**
```ts
import RandBox from 'randbox'
const rb = new RandBox()
const side = rb.coin?.()
const val = rb.normal?.({ mean: 0, stdev: 1 })
const uid = rb.guid?.()
```

## FAQ

- How are weights normalized?
  - Converted to probabilities summing to 1.
- Which method for normal distribution?
  - Commonly Box–Muller or Ziggurat.
